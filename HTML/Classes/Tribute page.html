      <div>
        <p>Born in Bombay(now Mumbai) on 28 December, 1937 and is the son of Naval Tata. Great grandfather was Jamsedji Tata, founder of the Tata group.Had a disturbed childhood since parents split. Raised by grandmother, Lady Navajbai.</p>
        <p>Received a degree in Architecture from Cornell University in 1959, and in 1975, attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School</p>
        <p>In 1962, he joined the Tata Group and his first job involved working with the Tata Steel division in Jamshedpur, where he worked with the blue-collar employees shoveling stone and working with the furnaces. He was appointed the Director-in-Charge of the National Radio & Electronics Company Limited (Nelco) in 1971 and was successful in turning Nelco around.</p>
        <p>Tata rose through the ranks of Tata Industries to become Chairman and was a driving force behind a slew of reforms. Tata Consultancy Services went public under his leadership, and Tata Motors was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, giving it greater international strength and prestige.</p>
        <p>He is recognised with directing the Tata Group's successful bid for Corus, an Anglo-Dutch steel and aluminium company, as well as the Ford Company's Jaguar and Land Rover brands.</p>
        <p>During his leadership, the company saw the birth of the 'Indica,' India's first fully Indian car.  Tata's food division purchased tea company Tetley for GBP 70 million in 2000. The group's revenues increased nearly 12-fold in 2009-10, totaling USD 67.4 billion.</p>
        <p>He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government in the year 2000. Ohio State University awarded him an honorary doctorate in business administration, the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok awarded him an honorary doctorate in technology, and the University of Warwick awarded him an honorary doctorate in science.</p>
        <p>Tata's personal fortune is around GBP 300 million, and he controls less than 1% of the conglomerate. Charitable trusts own about two-thirds of Tata Group, which helps to fund good causes.</p>
        <p>He has led development of many innovative designs and products, the most celebrated being Nano. The idea of Nano was born with his concern for the safety of nuclear families commuting on two-wheelers. He was the one who suggested that the miniature car should be fitted with just one windscreen wiper. This reduced its price and maintenance cost.</p> 
        <p>Tata, who is a bachelor in real life, values privacy and avoids the limelight. Only CDs, books, and pets keep him company. In an unassuming Tata sedan, the business baron drives himself to work.</p>
        <p>Standing tall with his contemporaries with a staggering fortune and world recognition, Ratan Tata has amazingly never featured in the ‘Forbes billionaires list’.</p>
